# SIMC Framework

Welcome to the SIMC Framework repository! This framework provides a robust platform for running and analyzing simulations using SimulationCraft (SimC) for World of Warcraft (WoW) character modeling.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: A user-friendly interface for inputting simulation data.
- **Flexibility**: Ability to run custom simulations with varying parameters.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate console output and status updates.
- **Custom Outputs**: The resulting HTML file automatically opens in another tab when the simulation is finished

## Getting Started

To get started with the SIMC Framework, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites that are needed to run the simulation framework. For example:

- SimulationCraft compiled and placed inside of the empty /Simc folder
- Python 3.6 or higher

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and run your framework. For example:

1. Navigate to the `app` directory within the cloned repository.
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all requirements
3. Execute `app.py` to start the simulation interface.

## Usage

- **1**: Start the app.py by running the script in vs code or console.
- **2**: Go to the site and enter a valid Simc Input string. These can be made manually or copied from Raidbots.com's simulation tools
- **3**: Immediate console output and status updates.
- **4**: Generates HTML results that can be viewed in any modern browser.
