# SIMC Framework

Welcome to the SIMC Framework repository! This framework provides a robust platform for running and analyzing simulations using SimulationCraft (SimC) for World of Warcraft (WoW) character modeling.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: A user-friendly interface for inputting simulation data.
- **Flexibility**: Ability to run custom simulations with varying parameters.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate console output and status updates.
- **Custom Outputs**: Generates HTML results that can be viewed in any modern browser.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SIMC Framework, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites that are needed to run the simulation framework. For example:

- SimulationCraft installed and accessible via command line
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Any other dependencies

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and run your framework. For example:

1. Navigate to the `app` directory within the cloned repository.
2. Run `python setup.py install` to install the necessary Python dependencies.
3. Execute `simc_interface.py` to start the simulation interface.

## Usage

Guide users on how to use the framework, including how to enter data, how to run simulations, and how to interpret results.

### Running a Simulation

Provide an example of how to run a simulation. For instance:


### Interpreting Results

Explain what the output files contain and how to make sense of the data presented.
